# RedWineAnalysis

This repository has been created under the context of the subject Typology and Data Life Cycle, belonging to the Master in Data Science at the Open University of Catalonia. In it, data cleaning and data analysis techniques are applied using R programming language to extract information from a dataset related with Red Wine quality from [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).
